<td>He was an orphan whose guardians lived in Tavistock, Devon. He was a reserved boy, short and stockily built, fair-haired and pale. He was remembered by contemporaries as one who led by example, rather than by inspiration, although paradoxically he was regarded as likely to fall short of the highest standards as a cricketer because of his recklessness at the crease.</td>

<p>In 1899, whilst a 13-year-old schoolboy, Collins scored the highest ever recorded cricket score of 628 not out.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> This feat took place during a junior school house cricket match between Clarke's House and North Town house. The match was played on an outfield off Guthrie Road, Bristol, now named <i>Collins' Piece</i>. The ground had both a poor surface and a very unusual shape: it was very short (only 60&#160;<a href="../../../y/a/r/Yard.html" title="Yard">yards</a> long), with a wall only 70&#160;yards away forming the <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundary_%28cricket%29.html" title="Boundary (cricket)">boundary</a> on one side, while the other side was a gentle slope falling away towards the school <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanatorium.html" title="Sanatorium">sanatorium</a> in the distance. All hits to the long boundary, down the slope, had to be all-run, but the three short boundaries only counted for two runs.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>On Thursday, <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_22.html" title="June 22">22 June</a>, Collins, a right-handed <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batsman.html" title="Batsman">batsman</a>, won the toss for Clarke's House and chose to bat first. Collins hit his first stroke at 3.30&#160;p.m. By the close of play at 6&#160;p.m., he had scored 200 runs.</p>
<p>School lessons allowed another two-and-a-half hours' play on Friday, <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_23.html" title="June 23">23 June</a>, and by then news of an exceptional innings had gone round the school. So brilliant was his play that even an Old Cliftonian match being played nearby lost its interest and a large crowd watched Collins' phenomenal performance. Collins' innings almost ended at 400 when an easy <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catch.html" title="Catch">catch</a> was dropped, but at around 5.30&#160;p.m. – only some five hours after he started – he overtook <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Stoddart_fb55.html" title="Andrew Stoddart">Andrew Stoddart</a>'s then world-record score of 485 to rapturous applause. At the end of the second day, he remained unbeaten on 509.</p>
<p>The match resumed on Monday, <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_26.html" title="June 26">26 June</a>, at 12.30&#160;p.m., but the school authorities extended the hours available for play in a bid to speed the end of the match. As the crowds continued to grow and media interest escalated, the disruption to school life was considerable. Collins played his part: his approach was described as "downright reckless" as he hit out, and he was dropped twice more when on 605 and 619. By the end of the day, Collins had reached 598 but he was rapidly running out of partners. On Tuesday, <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_27.html" title="June 27">27 June</a>, after just 25 minutes' play, Collins lost his final partner, Thomas Redfern, caught by Victor Fuller-Eberle at <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fielding_%28cricket%29.html" title="Fielding (cricket)">point</a> for 13, with Collins' score on 628. Collins had played less than seven hours' cricket, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrying_his_bat.html" title="Carrying his bat">carrying his bat</a> through his side's innings.</p>
<p>North Town house, demoralised, were bowled out for 87 in 90 minutes on Tuesday. The match resumed on Wednesday <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_28.html" title="June 28">28 June</a>, when North Town's second innings went even worse, making 61 in just over an hour, so Clarke House won by an innings and 688 runs. Collins showed some ability as an <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-rounder.html" title="All-rounder">all-rounder</a>, with his right-arm medium pace <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowling_%28cricket%29.html" title="Bowling (cricket)">bowling</a> taking 11 <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wicket.html" title="Wicket">wickets</a> for 63 <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_%28cricket%29.html" title="Run (cricket)">runs</a>.</p>
<p>The scorebook hangs in the pavilion at Clifton to this day. The scorers faced a difficult task in accurately recording the innings. One of them, Edward Peglar, is said to have remarked that Collins's score was "628, plus or minus twenty shall we say". The other scorer for the match was JW Hall, whose father in 1868 had batted with <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Tylecote_703e.html" title="Edward Tylecote">Edward Tylecote</a>, who later played <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_cricket.html" title="Test cricket">Test cricket</a> for <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_cricket_team.html" title="English cricket team">England</a> and whose name is on a poem kept with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ashes_d6c5.html" title="The Ashes">the Ashes</a> urn, when Tylecote had set an early world-record score of 404 not out, also at Clifton.</p>
<p>Collins became public property for a long while after the match, forever associated with his great score. "Today all men speak of him," wrote one newspaper, "... he has a reputation as great as the most advertised soap: he will be immortalised." After leaving school, he never wanted to be reminded of his famous innings; nevertheless, he has been remembered well beyond his own lifetime.</p>
