    editor1.cpp  (c) 1996 - 2001 Kari Laitinen

    This program is the source code of a text editor called "zedit".

    The buyers of Kari Laitinen's book on C++ computer programming
    may freely use and further develop this editor program. They
    may not, however, sell this editor or use it in commercial
    purposes.

    Mr. Kari Laitinen has used this editor program to write
    and modify most of the source programs that belong to his
    book on C++ computer programming. However, Mr. Kari Laitinen
    does not assume any responsibility or liability regarding this
    editor program or its use. The users of this editor program may

  PROGRAM MODIFICATION HISTORY

---------------------------------------------------------------------

    06.10.1996  ( file created )
    22.10.1996  ( editor1.cpp )
    22.09.1998  One month of serious development work completed.
                A kind of beta testing begins now.
    29.10.1998  A reasonably working version of the program.
    30.01.1999  keyboard_decoding_table was modified to work
                with correctly-behaving getch in Borland's
                C++ 5.3 (Part of C++ Builder 3)
    17.02.2000  Short file names not allowed while storing texts.
                Member cursor_movement_style is added into
                class Edition. This style is constant for the time
                being, and cursor moves beyond line ends in some cases
    02.02.2001  Tabulator-free, version-showing version 1.3
    07.02.2001  v1.3.1 Some improvements in screen updating.

    Version number must be written in ZEDIT_EDITOR_VERSION_TEXT

----------------------------------------------------------------------

  COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS

----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - This progam can be compiled with the following compilers:

    --  bcc32.exe compiler in Borland C++ 5.2 (The resulting
        editor may work correctly only with U.S.-style keyboards.)

    --  bcc32.exe 5.3 compiler in Borland C++ Builder 3.
        The 5.3 - version has been working well about 2 years.

    --  bcc32.exe 5.5.1 of Borland's Free Command Line Tools
        Testing of 5.5.1 -version zedit begun on 2.1.2001


----------------------------------------------------------------------

  KNOWN PROBLEMS IN THE SOFTWARE

----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -  This editor is to be executed in an MS-DOS Window in Windows.
     This program does not check in any ways if somebody is trying
     to close the MS-DOS window by clicking its corner with the 
     mouse. If the MS-DOS window is closed while this editor
     is running in that particular window, it is possible that
     the text being edited is lost.

  -  There have been some problems with editing files written
     with other editors. It is possible that if the files contain
     very long text lines, this program stops reading the file
     when it encounters a too long line.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

  SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT NOTES

----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - It is better to have this file named "editor1.cpp" instead
    of "zedit.cpp". I have worked so that "editor1.exe" is always
    renamed to "zedit.exe" after it has been found
    working well enough. This way it is possible to use an earlier
    version of zedit to develop a new version of the editor program.

  - This editor uses function getch, defined in conio.h, to read
    single characters from the keyboard. This function is
    appropriate for an editor program which just reads characters
    without expecting the Enter key to be pressed. There has been
    problems in reading the keyboard. The following is a summary
    of the problems:

    -- In bcc32 5.2, the function reads the keyboard approximately
       as it were an American keyboard. This problem occurs only
       with 32-bit compiler bcc32. The 16-bit compiler bcc would
       work correctly, but this program cannot be compiled with it.

    -- The bcc32 5.3 compiler that belongs to C++ Builder 3 seems 
       to have a rather decent getch function. There are only the
       keys containing tilde and carat signs and some accent marks
       that the function reads so that it produces some extra
       characters. It seems also that when the numerical keyboard
       is locked, the getch function produces a wrong code for
       the Delete key. These are, however, minor problems. 


  - C++ compiler generates operator= functions, the assignment
    functions, if the user does not specify these member funtions.
    The automatic operator= functions do not work with
    classes that use memory on the free store. Therefore,
    classes Text_line and Array_of_text_lines have
    specially-written assignment functions.
    When Edition objects are copied, these assignment functions
    are called since Text_line objects and Array_of_text_lines
    objects are members of Edition objects.

  - Class Text_line had to be equipped with a copy constructor
    before it started work properly.

  - Class Screen is used to maintain the text that is currently
    on the screen. The class contains several functions to update
    text on screen. Updating the screen is slightly problematic
    because the screen begins to blink if the entire screen
    is updated too often (e.g. after every keystroke). The several
    member functions in class Screen help in this problem. If the
    screen could be updated without any blinking problems, the
    easiest way would be to have one function (e.g. in class
    Array_of_text_lines) to update the screen after each
    text-modifying keystroke.

  - An object of class Edition corresponds to a file being edited.
    The name of the class is Edition (and not, for example, File)
    because Edition objects can exist before they are actually
    connected to any named files.

   "\n       that are copied into the buffer."
   "\n     - F8 copies the text buffer into current cursor position."
   "\n     - F9 searches a name or word found in the cursor position."

   "\n     - F11 performs an unconditional Find-and-Replace operation."
   "\n     - F12 performs a Find operation."

   "\n  SOME SPECIAL KEYS:"
   "\n  "
   "\n     - Ctrl-A deletes text between cursor position and line end."
   "\n     - Ctrl-Z deletes the line where the cursor is."
   "\n     - Ctrl-N (\"Next\") finds (and replaces) next string."
   "\n     - Ctrl-E Help. Displays these pages."
   "\n     - Ctrl-W lets you jump (wander!) to a certain line in the text."
   "\n     - Ctrl-T lets you set a tag (bookmark) in current cursor"
   "\n              position. (More information below)."
   "\n     - Ctrl-X opens you the file menu.",

   "\n  "
   "\n  SETTING TAGS (BOOKMARKS) IN THE TEXT:"
   "\n  "
   "\n     - By pressing Ctrl-T you can set a tag (bookmark) in the"
   "\n       text being currently edited."
   "\n     - Tags are useful when you edit a large file, and want"
   "\n       to go somewhere else in the file and later return back"
   "\n       to the original position in the file."
   "\n     - The tags affect the behavior of the Home and End keys."
   "\n     - Normally, when no tags have been defined, the Home key"
   "\n       brings the cursor to the beginning of the first line in"
   "\n       the text, and the End key brings the cursor to the end"
   "\n       of the last line."
   "\n     - But when tags are defined somewhere between the first"
   "\n       and last lines, the Home and End keys make stops in"
   "\n       the tags."
   "\n     - Because the editor program remembers the tags as cursor"
   "\n       coordinates, the tags become slightly inaccurate when the"
   "\n       text is modified."
   "\n  ",

   "\n  YOU CAN INVOKE this editor from the command line in three"

   "\n    2)   zedit  filename1.ext"
   "\n"
   "\n    3)   zedit  filename1.ext  filename2.ext"
   "\n"
   "\n  In the first case, the editor does not open a file, but it"
   "\n  lets you to type in text on the screen. It asks a file name"
   "\n  when you try save or close the edition. In the two other"
   "\n  cases, the editor tries to open the files that are given on"

   "\n  characters. Instead, the editor inserts 3 spaces into"
   "\n  text if the tabulator key is used, or it finds"
   "\n  a tabulator character from a file."
   "\n  "
   "\n    When tabulators are not used, it is possible to print"
   "\n  a source program with many different printing programs, and"
   "\n  the program text always looks the same. Tabulators can"

/*-------------------

      Encoding the characters that make the words in natural
      languages is a problematic task. In the world of personal
      computers, the 8-bit ASCII coding is in use. However,
      although we can encode most visible characters with 8 bits,
      there are some special characters, or keys on the keyboard,
      which require more than 8 bits to be encoded.

      Unicode is a new system to give numerical values to
      characters. Unicodes are 16-bit codes, which means that
      we can express 256 times more characters with Unicodes
      than with the 8-bit ASCII codes.

      The following keyboard_decoding_table is used to give
      Unicode values to all characters that are read from
      the keyboard. The first 256 Unicodes are the same as the
      256 codes in the 8-bit ASCII coding system which is, 
      for example, used in the Windows operating system.

      For example, the letter keys of the keyboard of a personal
      computer produce 8-bit ASCII-codes which directly correspond
      with Unicodes. But there are special keys such as the
      cursor movement keys and the function keys F1, F2, F3, etc.
      which produce 2-byte extended key codes. The first byte of
      an extended key code is zero and the second byte says
      which key was pressed.

      Extended key codes of function keys are the following:

               Basic    Shift    Ctrl     Alt

      F1       00 3B    00 54    00 5E    00 68
      F2       00 3C    00 55    00 5F    00 69
      F3       00 3D    00 56    00 60    00 6A
      F4       00 3E    00 57    00 61    00 6B
      F5       00 3F    00 58    00 62    00 6C
      F6       00 40    00 59    00 63    00 6D
      F7       00 41    00 5A    00 64    00 6E
      F8       00 42    00 5B    00 65    00 6F
      F9       00 43    00 5C    00 66    00 70
      F10      00 44    00 5D    00 67    00 71
      F11      00 85    00 87    00 89    00 8B
      F12      00 86    00 88    00 8A    00 8C

      Other special keys have the following extended codes:

      Insert      00 52
      Delete      00 53
      Home        00 47
      End         00 4F
      Page Up     00 49
      Page Down   00 51
      Arrow Left  00 4B
      Arrow Up    00 48
      Arrow Down  00 50
      Arrow Right 00 4D


      This function converts extended key codes into 16-bit
      codes according to the following principle:


      Key       Code       Conversion

      Ctrl-F1   00  5E     15E
      Ctrl-F2   00  5F     15F
      Ctrl-F3   00  60     160

          etc.  etc.


      The following example shows how this function works:

        -  the user of the computer presses Arrow Up key
        -  this results in that the codes 00H 48H are
           received from the keyboard
        -  this function detects that the first byte is
           zero, so it reads the second byte
        -  having received 48H as the second byte of the
           extended key code, this function forms the code
           148H
        -  code 148H is used as an index in the 
           keyboard_decoding_table and value 1004 is returned
           to the caller of the function, value 1004 is the
           Unicode value of Arrow Up key

      I must admit that I do not know how official the
      Unicodes (1004 etc.) of the special keys in the table are.
      I found these values for the special keys while I was
      experimenting with a Java program that could show the
      numerical values of various keys. As the Unicode system
      is the official character coding system in Java, I
      concluded that these must be appropriate codes.
      It can be that these codes are not very official after all.

      The following table is included in this program because of
      historical reasons. The table was used to convert a U.S.-style
      keyboard to Finnish style, and also to give
      Unicode values to cursor movement keys. The table was needed
      because the getch function in Borland C++ 5.2 seemed to read
      all keyboards like U.S. keyboards. This problem does not exist
      any more with Borland C++ 5.3 compiler.

      The table is just saved here without any particular reason.
      You never know: some day it might be needed. Inside function
      Editor::get_next_key_code there is a similar table which just
      converts extended key codes to Unicode values.

      It seems to be impossible to put character constants
      '', '', '', '', '', and '' to the table because
      the compiler interprets them as negative numbers.

      The following codes mean Scandinavian special
      characters:

      0x84  means  ''   0x8E   means  ''
      0x94  means  ''   0x99   means  ''
      0x86  means  ''   0x8F   means  ''

      To further increase the confusion, note that this file
      was written with Zedit and other MS-DOS editors. This means
      that if you view this file with a Windows editor or print
      the file with a Windows printing program, the above
      characters do not print properly. The ASCII coding system
      in MS-DOS is slightly different from that in Windows.
